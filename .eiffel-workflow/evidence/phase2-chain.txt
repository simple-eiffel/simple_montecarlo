## Summary of Findings

### High Severity Issues (2)
1. compute_statistics placeholder - needs real statistics calculation
2. run_simulation agent validation - ALREADY CORRECT (verified)

### Medium Severity Issues (1)
1. extract_all_measurements placeholder - needs iteration + extraction logic

### Low Severity Issues (2)
1. make constructor validation - REJECT suggestion (redundant with precondition)
2. outcome_at indexing - needs clarification (1-based user, 0-based internal)

## Conclusion

✓ CONTRACTS APPROVED FOR PHASE 3

All identified issues are:
- Implementation-level (not design flaws)
- Actionable within Phase 4 scope
- Properly tracked in synopsis.md

No contract rework required.

## Next Steps

1. USER APPROVAL REQUIRED: Review synopsis.md and approve proceeding to Phase 3
2. Phase 3: Run `/eiffel.tasks d:\prod\simple_montecarlo` to generate implementation task breakdown
3. Phase 4: Implement feature bodies per task specifications
4. Phase 5: Implement 55 test cases
