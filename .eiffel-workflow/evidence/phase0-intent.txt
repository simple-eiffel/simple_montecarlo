# Phase 0 Intent Evidence
# Project: d:\prod\simple_montecarlo
# Date: 2026-01-27 (this session)

## Intent Document Status
Intent document created: .eiffel-workflow/intent.md
- Complete with all sections: What, Why, Users, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope
- Dependencies declared: simple_probability, simple_randomizer, simple_math, simple_mml
- MML decision: YES - Required (collections and frame conditions needed)
- 3 Personas validated with realistic workflows
- Phase 1 deliverables clearly specified
- Open questions for specification phase documented

## AI Review Status
AI review prompt prepared: .eiffel-workflow/prompts/phase0-intent-review.md
- Prompt includes complete intent.md for external reviewer
- Review criteria documented: vague language, missing edge cases, untestable criteria, etc.
- Output format specified: 7-10 probing questions with options and impact analysis
- Evidence placeholder created: .eiffel-workflow/evidence/phase0-ai-review.md

## Next Actions
1. User submits intent review prompt to external AI (Claude, Ollama, Grok, Gemini, etc.)
2. External AI generates 7-10 probing questions with options
3. User pastes AI response into .eiffel-workflow/evidence/phase0-ai-review.md
4. User returns and says "review complete"
5. Claude asks user to answer each probing question
6. Answers incorporated into intent-v2.md
7. Final approval requested
8. Proceed to /eiffel.contracts for Phase 1 specification

## Context
- Research phase COMPLETED (research/*.md files present)
- Specification phase COMPLETED (spec/*.md files present)
- Phase 0 Intent phase NOW IN PROGRESS
- After review: Phase 1 Contracts specification via /eiffel.contracts

## Notes
- simple_montecarlo is advanced project: post-research, post-spec, now capturing intent for Phase 1 design
- Intent synthesized from existing research/spec work
- MML dependency explicit (simple_mml will be required for outcome collection frame conditions)
- Phased delivery strategy clear: MVP Phase 1, diagnostics Phase 1.5, Bayesian Phase 2
- Personas validated against realistic industrial use cases
