[✓] Step 4: DECISIONS (04-DECISIONS.md)
    - D-001: Semantic API (Experiment vs Sampler) → Experiment
    - D-002: simple_probability dependency → Full integration
    - D-003: Agent-based trial logic → Flexible, Eiffel-native
    - D-004: In-memory results Phase 1 → Streaming Phase 2
    - D-005: Heuristic convergence Phase 1 → Diagnostic Phase 2
    - D-006: Semantic types for type safety → TRIAL_OUTCOME ≠ MEASUREMENT
    - D-007: Sequential Phase 1, parallel Phase 2 → Reduces complexity
    - D-008: Examples-first documentation → Engage non-math audience
    - D-009: DBC + Exceptions hybrid → Eiffel + pragmatism

[✓] Step 6: RISKS (06-RISKS.md - created inline)
    - RISK-001: Semantic API confuses experts (Mitigation: add aliases Phase 2)
    - RISK-002: Non-math docs miss mark (Mitigation: user testing Phase 0.5)
    - RISK-003: Performance insufficient >1M (Mitigation: optimize Phase 1.5)
    - RISK-004: Parallelism complexity (Phase 2) (Mitigation: design Phase 1)
    - RISK-005: Eiffel adoption low (Mitigation: market positioning)

[✓] Step 7: RECOMMENDATION (07-RECOMMENDATION.md)
    - Action: BUILD (high confidence 85%+)
    - Approach: Phased (Phase 1 MVP, Phase 1.5 optional, Phase 2 Bayesian+Parallel)
    - Timeline: 3-4 weeks Phase 1 → v1.0.0 production
    - Success: Non-math users can write industrial MC simulations

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:
✓ Algorithms mature (Monte Carlo well-understood; no novel research)
✓ Architecture clear (experiment framework + distribution integration)
✓ Integration points identified (simple_probability, simple_randomizer)
✓ Parallelism path clear (agent-based trials for SCOOP Phase 2)

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
✓ Type safety (compile-time error catching vs runtime surprises)
✓ Semantic API (non-math friendly; unique positioning)
✓ SCOOP concurrency (true parallelism; no GIL)
✓ Production reliability (void-safe, verified, embedded-ready)

RISK PROFILE:
✓ Low technical risk (established algorithms)
✓ Medium market risk (non-math adoption TBD)
✓ Low schedule risk (phased approach; clear gates)
✓ All risks mitigatable (no blockers)

DECISION OUTCOMES
================================================================================

All 10 major decisions made with clear rationale and reversibility:

    Reversible: Add statistical aliases Phase 2
    Risk: Low (business framing resonates)

[✓] D-002: Full simple_probability dependency
    Reversible: Could support independent distributions (unlikely)
    Risk: Low (natural integration)

[✓] D-003: Agent-based trial logic
    Reversible: Add class-based inheritance option Phase 2
    Risk: Low (agents proven Eiffel pattern)

[✓] D-004: In-memory results Phase 1
    Reversible: Add streaming backend Phase 2 (API compatible)
    Risk: Medium (1M outcome limit; acceptable for MVP)

[✓] D-005: Heuristic convergence Phase 1
    Reversible: Add Gelman-Rubin R̂ Phase 2 (upgrade)
    Risk: Low (heuristics good enough for MVP)

    Reversible: Add phantom types Phase 2 (additive)
    Risk: Low (uniquely enables type safety)

[✓] D-007: Sequential Phase 1, parallel Phase 2
    Reversible: Trivial to add parallelism (backend change)
    Risk: Low (reduces Phase 1 complexity)

[✓] D-008: Examples-first documentation
