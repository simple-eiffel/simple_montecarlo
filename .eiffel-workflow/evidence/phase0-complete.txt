# Phase 0: COMPLETE
# Project: d:\prod\simple_montecarlo
# Date: 2026-01-27
# Status: APPROVED FOR PHASE 1

## Phase 0 Workflow Summary

### Step 1: Initial Intent Created ✓
- File: .eiffel-workflow/intent.md
- Status: Comprehensive with all 12 sections
- Includes: What, Why, Users, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope, Dependencies, MML Decision

### Step 2: AI Review Generated ✓
- Method: Ollama (deepseek-coder-v2:16b)
- Questions: 8 probing questions covering API design, testing, acceptance criteria, workflows, edge cases, error handling, dependencies, MML rationale
- File: .eiffel-workflow/evidence/phase0-ai-review.md

### Step 3: Stakeholder Q&A Completed ✓
- Questions answered: 8 of 8
- Format: AskUserQuestion tool (2 rounds)
- Responses synthesized into intent-v2.md

### Step 4: Intent Refined ✓
- File: .eiffel-workflow/intent-v2.md
- Clarifications incorporated:
  - Semantic API definitions formalized with code examples
  - Testing strategy detailed: 55 tests across unit, integration, statistical, performance
  - CI correctness: statistical power analysis validation approach
  - User prerequisites: basic Eiffel programming (not probability/statistics)
  - Reproducibility: byte-identical seeding across Windows/Linux/MacOS
  - Error handling: focused on preconditions for user-friendly validation
  - Dependency integration: tight coupling with simple_probability
  - MML rationale: educational framing for non-technical users
  - Documentation: non-math intro + 3 industrial examples + glossary

### Step 5: Final Approval ✓
- User approved intent-v2.md
- Ready for Phase 1 Contracts specification

## Evidence Files Created

1. **intent.md** — Initial comprehensive intent
2. **intent-v2.md** — Refined intent incorporating all stakeholder feedback
3. **prompts/phase0-intent-review.md** — AI review prompt template
4. **evidence/phase0-ai-review.md** — AI review output (8 questions with options)
5. **evidence/phase0-complete.txt** — This completion marker

## Key Decisions Locked In

### API Design
- Formal definitions: Experiment, Trial, Outcome, Measurement
- Semantic naming unique to Eiffel (not notation-heavy like PyMC)
- Code examples in documentation showing real workflows

### Testing
- 55 tests total: 30 unit + 15 integration + 5 statistical + 3 performance + 2 accessibility
- Statistical validation: 95% of 95% CIs contain true parameter
- Scale testing: 1K, 100K, 1M trials

### User Model
- Prerequisite: basic Eiffel programming (agents, method calls)
- NOT required: probability, statistics, math beyond high school algebra
- Personas 1-3 represent concrete use cases from manufacturing, automotive, IoT

### Reproducibility
- Same seed = byte-identical results across Windows/Linux/MacOS
- Test: seeds 0, 1, 42, 2^31-1 across all distributions and trial counts

### Dependencies
- Tight integration with simple_probability (direct method calls)
- simple_mml required for frame conditions on outcome collections
- simple_randomizer (via simple_probability) for RNG foundation

### MML Justification
- Educational: explain frame conditions plainly to non-technical users
- "MML ensures outcome collection doesn't mysteriously shrink due to bugs"
- Phase 2 relevance: SCOOP parallelism requires frame conditions on shared data

## Readiness Checklist

- [x] Intent document captures WHAT users need (API, features, examples)
- [x] Intent documents WHY (market gap, Eiffel advantages, non-math accessibility)
- [x] Intent identifies WHO (3 Personas with concrete workflows)
- [x] Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- [x] Out of Scope is clearly defined (defer to Phase 2)
- [x] Dependencies are explicit (simple_probability, simple_mml, simple_math, simple_randomizer)
- [x] MML decision is justified and explained educationally
- [x] Phase 1 deliverables are clearly scoped (5 classes, 55 tests, documentation)
- [x] User feedback incorporated (8 Q&A refined all ambiguities)
- [x] Final approval obtained

## Next Phase

**Phase 1: Contracts** — Generate class and test skeletons with DBC contracts

Command: `/eiffel.contracts d:\prod\simple_montecarlo`

This will produce:
- MONTE_CARLO_EXPERIMENT.e with require/ensure/invariant contracts
- TRIAL_OUTCOME.e with state contracts
- MEASUREMENT.e with type-safety contracts
- SIMULATION_STATISTICS.e with aggregation contracts
- TRIAL_LOGIC.e (agent signature)
- TEST_APP.e (test runner skeleton)
- LIB_TESTS.e (test suite skeleton)

## Context Preserved

If context compresses, query oracle:
```
oracle-cli.exe query "simple_montecarlo Phase 0 intent"
oracle-cli.exe query "simple_montecarlo acceptance criteria"
```

All intent details are preserved in:
- intent.md (initial)
- intent-v2.md (refined) ← AUTHORITATIVE
- phase0-ai-review.md (justifications)
- phase0-complete.txt (this file)

**PHASE 0 STATUS: ✓ APPROVED AND COMPLETE**

Ready to proceed to Phase 1 Contracts specification.
