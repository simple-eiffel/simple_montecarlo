Bayesian reasoning was first articulated
0:15
by the Reverend Thomas Bayes,
0:18
a clergyman from Tunbridge Wells
0:19
in southern England,
0:21
way back in the 18th Century.
0:23
Bayes wasn't well-known in his lifetime.
0:26
In fact, his theory wasn't published
0:28
until two years after he had died.
0:30
But his work has gone on
0:31
to profoundly shape science, medicine
0:34
and artificial intelligence.
0:36
It even helped crack the Nazis' Enigma code
0:39
during World War II.
What is Bayesian logic?
0:41
So what is Bayesian reasoning
0:43
and how can it help us understand the world?
0:46
Thomas Bayes introduced two vital ideas.
0:50
First, that our beliefs
0:52
can be expressed as probabilities,
0:54
and second, how our beliefs
0:56
should be revised when we obtain more information.
1:00
Essentially, he produced a theory
1:02
for learning from experience.
1:04
Bayesian analysis can be used in any situation
1:07
where each new item of information
1:09
changes our beliefs.
Alan Turing and the Enigma code
1:11
Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park
1:14
used Bayesian ideas to learn about
1:17
the settings of Enigma machines in World War II,
1:20
changing their opinion as new patterns were found.
1:23
The spam filter on your email account
1:26
will use Bayesian analysis to change
1:28
its probability that your email message is spam
1:31
as each new suspicious feature is detected.
Bayesian analysis in breast cancer screening
1:34
Take breast cancer screening in the UK.
1:37
Mammograms are rather accurate,
1:40
detecting about 90% of cancers,
1:42
and 97% of women without cancer
1:45
correctly get a negative test result.
1:48
But what about the other 3%?
1:50
Let's consider what we would expect to happen
1:53
to 100 women being tested.
1:55
Based on past experience of the rate
1:57
of breast cancer among women getting mammograms,
2:00
we would expect one out of the 100
2:02
to have cancer, and that case is almost certain
2:04
to be picked up on the mammogram.
2:06
Of the remaining 99 without cancer,
2:09
we would expect three women
2:11
to get a false positive result.
2:13
So in total, we expect 1 + 3 = 4 equals 4
2:16
positive tests, but only one actually has cancer.
2:20
From this perspective, looking only at the women
2:22
who get a positive result,
2:24
perhaps the test does not seem so accurate.
2:27
Around three out of four,
2:28
or 75% of the women recalled,
2:31
don't have cancer.
2:33
Further tests should rapidly identify
2:35
these three false positives.
2:37
This is an example of using Bayesian analysis.
2:40
Since we are taking into account the base rate
2:42
for the condition, our prior probability
2:45
that a random woman being tested
2:47
has breast cancer is 1%,
2:49
and after getting a positive test result,
2:52
this is updated to what is called
2:53
a posterior probability,
2:55
which is one out of four, or 25%.
2:58
Of course, further investigations
3:00
will eventually change the probabilities
3:02
of those who are recalled
3:04
either to 0% or, less fortunately, 100%.
3:08
The use of Bayesian analysis
3:11
in medical testing is now standard.
Bayesian methods in science - so-called Bayesian inference
3:13
However, more controversial
3:15
is the use of Bayesian methods in science -
3:18
so-called Bayesian inference.
3:20
The traditional view of science is that
3:23
it is a completely objective activity,
3:25
that data is analysed without preconceptions
3:28
and the results speak for themselves.
3:31
The Bayesian perspective is somewhat different.
3:33
It acknowledges that there are always
3:36
judgments underlying every analysis
3:38
and that we don't start from a blank slate.
3:41
Each set of data adds to our existing knowledge,
3:44
rather than standing entirely on its own.
3:46
For example, clinical trials of new drugs
3:49
are not designed in complete ignorance.
3:52
There is always some historical evidence
3:54
available about the potential effectiveness
3:56
of the new therapy, and expert judgments can
3:59
be elicited and used to prioritise investigations
4:02
and produce efficient designs.
Do we have Bayesian brains?
4:04
And it's even thought
4:06
that we have Bayesian brains.
4:08
We don't start from scratch to interpret
4:10
our sensations for each second that passes.
4:13
Instead, we always have prior expectations
4:16
of what we might experience next,
4:18
and then new observations
4:20
update our beliefs accordingly.
Conclusions
4:23
Fundamentally, Bayesian ideas
4:25
reflect what it means to be human.
4:27
We live in a world of uncertainty,
4:29
but we always have prior expectations
4:31
of what might happen next, and we revise
4:34
that uncertainty as we learn from experience.
4:37
All based on the ideas
4:38
of a rather obscure 18th-century cleric
4:42
from Tunbridge Wells.
